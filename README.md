# Wallhaven favorite pictures (default) sync

This application syncs the pictures in your default favorites Wallhaven.cc list to a folder of your choosing.

For now, change the hardcode settings in main.go before build and run. 

```
outputFolder := "/Users/****/Downloads/wallhaven"
	apiKey := "eX****"
	username := "****"
```
